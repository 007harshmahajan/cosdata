* Quaternary Multiplication Using Bitwise Operations

** Introduction
This document describes the process of performing 2-bit quaternary multiplication using bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, SHIFT) without directly using the multiplication operator.

** Problem Statement
Given two 2-bit quaternary numbers, we need to multiply them using only bitwise operations.

** Representation
Quaternary numbers are represented in binary form:
- 2 in quaternary is 10 in binary
- 3 in quaternary is 11 in binary

** Steps for Multiplication
1. Extract the lower and higher bits from each quaternary number.
2. Compute the partial products using bitwise AND operations.
3. Shift the partial products accordingly.
4. Combine the partial products using bitwise XOR operations to include carries.

** Detailed Example

*** Example: Multiply quaternary numbers 2 (10 in binary) and 3 (11 in binary)

1. Convert quaternary to binary:
   - 2 in quaternary is 10 in binary.
   - 3 in quaternary is 11 in binary.

2. Define binary numbers ~A~ and ~B~:
   - ~A = 0b10~ (2 in binary)
   - ~B = 0b11~ (3 in binary)

3. Extract the bits:
   - ~a0 = A & 0b11 = 0b10 & 0b11 = 0b10 = 2~
   - ~a1 = (A >> 2) & 0b11 = (0b10 >> 2) & 0b11 = 0~
   - ~b0 = B & 0b11 = 0b11 & 0b11 = 0b11 = 3~
   - ~b1 = (B >> 2) & 0b11 = (0b11 >> 2) & 0b11 = 0~

4. Compute the partial products using AND and shifts:
   - ~P0 = (a0 & 0b01) & (b0 & 0b01) = (10 & 01) & (11 & 01) = 00~
   - ~P1 = ((a0 & 0b10) >> 1) & (b0 & 0b01) = ((10 & 10) >> 1) & (11 & 01) = (10 >> 1) & 01 = 01 & 01 = 01~
   - ~P2 = (a0 & 0b01) & ((b0 & 0b10) >> 1) = (10 & 01) & ((11 & 10) >> 1) = 00 & (10 >> 1) = 00 & 01 = 00~
   - ~P3 = ((a0 & 0b10) >> 1) & ((b0 & 0b10) >> 1) = ((10 & 10) >> 1) & ((11 & 10) >> 1) = (10 >> 1) & (10 >> 1) = 01 & 01 = 01~

5. Shift the results accordingly:
   - ~result1 = P1 << 1 = 0b01 << 1 = 0b10~
   - ~result2 = P2 << 1 = 0b00 << 1 = 0b00~
   - ~result3 = P3 << 2 = 0b01 << 2 = 0b100~

6. Combine all the results using XOR to include carries:
   - ~P = P0 ^ result1 ^ result2 ^ result3 = 0b00 ^ 0b10 ^ 0b00 ^ 0b100 = 0b110 = 6 in decimal~

** Result
The result of multiplying 2 (10) by 3 (11) in quaternary using bitwise operations is 6 in decimal.

** Pseudocode
#+begin_src python
def quaternary_multiply(A, B):
    a0 = A & 0b11
    a1 = (A >> 2) & 0b11
    b0 = B & 0b11
    b1 = (B >> 2) & 0b11

    P0 = (a0 & 0b01) & (b0 & 0b01)
    P1 = ((a0 & 0b10) >> 1) & (b0 & 0b01)
    P2 = (a0 & 0b01) & ((b0 & 0b10) >> 1)
    P3 = ((a0 & 0b10) >> 1) & ((b0 & 0b10) >> 1)

    result1 = P1 << 1
    result2 = P2 << 1
    result3 = P3 << 2

    return P0 ^ result1 ^ result2 ^ result3

# Example usage
A = 0b10
B = 0b11
result = quaternary_multiply(A, B)
print(result)  # Output: 6
